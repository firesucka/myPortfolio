      <h2 class="title">Was spring-heeled Jack Bataman's greatgrandfather?</h2>
      <p>
        <b>In the long past year of 1839, at the beginning of England’s Victorian
          Era, rumours started to circle of a mysterious figure that was wandering
          through the villages near London. Under the veil of darkness, it would
          attack women, tearing up
          their clothing with its claws…</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        This description would suit yet another masked figure - except that
        Batman would focus on criminals instead of young women.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rumours about him spread quickly, thanks to the fact that his first
        close encounter with an 80-year-old Jane Aslop was published, along with
        his description. She insisted that it was a monster: “it spat blue and
        white flames” and it “tore
        my neck with its claws”.
      </p>

      <img class="media" src="./jack-2-was-the-original-inspiration-for-batman-a-creepy-victorian-menace.jpeg" alt="This is an image of Jack scaring young women.">
      <p>
        Many people of that time believed that Spring-heeled Jack - as they have
        called this creature - was in fact a monster capable of moving at an
        incomprehensible speed and that it sometimes leapt 6 meters into the air.
      </p>
      <p>
        The official response was that all of these sightings were linked to a
        letter which was sent to the lord mayor of London, published earlier in
        early 1838:
      </p>
      <p>
        “It seems like some individuals have made a bet about an ominous and
        inconsiderate friend (still of an unknown name), who does not dare to
        accept the blame on himself for visiting a lot of villages near London,
        being disguised as three figures - a ghost, a bear and a devil.”

        Many have suspected the aristocrat Henry Beresford, Marquess of Waterford,
        a man which was renowned in the city during that time - however, nothing
        has been proven.

        (Wait a second! A famous, powerful young man who was suspected to be the
        ominous figure and who was under the cover of darkness? Did Bruce Wayne
        have a Victorian great grandfather?)

        And so, the legend rose of the aristocrat that wandered the villages,
        terrorizing young women, in a similar fashion as had Jack the Ripper 50
        years later in London itself.
      </p>

      <img class="media" src="jack-4-was-the-original-inspiration-for-batman-a-creepy-victorian-menace.jpeg" alt="Jack is encountering some British Soldiers.">

      <p>
        In the coming decades, rumours about Jack and his foul deeds spread
        further - even though reports of him became rarer, people across England
        talked about mysterious attacks on post chariots, women being assaulted,
        and up until 1877, they even
        talked about groups of soldiers being attacked by the figure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rumours about it being a demon which was summoned by occult devil
        worshipers have spread, it was even said that it was not of this world -
        it was seen in a similar fashion as Batman was by the criminals he was
        chasing at the beginning of his crime-fighting career.
      </p>


      <img class="media" src="jack5-was-the-original-inspiration-for-batman-a-creepy-victorian-menace.jpeg" alt="Jackm portrayed as the devil, attacks people attending the church.">

      <p>
        Things became even more strange… After 1870, rumours about Jack became
        rarer. Eventually, he started to emerge in works of fiction. His first
        appearance was as a melodramatic anti-hero, then, sometime later, he
        emerged as some kind of
        superhero.
      </p>
      <p>
        The thing is, Spring-heeled Jack was finished long before Batman’s
        creation.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the late 20th century, Jack began to reemerge - he even traversed
        the Atlantic ocean, having his first appearance in Northern Carolina in
        1973 - described as “a skinny, long-haired man with pointy ears and
        glowing red eyes, who leapt 50 to 65 feet into the air.”
      </p>


      <img class="media" src="jack6-was-the-original-inspiration-for-batman-a-creepy-victorian-menace.jpeg" alt="Jack on the rooftops portraying looking a lot like batman.">

      <p>
        Texas locals saw that “the creature was 6 feet tall, had pointy ears, and
        jumped across the football field in just a couple of leaps - like an
        astronaut on the Moon.” in 1979.
      </p>
      <p>Even to this day, Jack still appears.</p>

      <p>
        Allegedly, in 2012 it terrorized a family in England, which claimed that
        it saw as “the mysterious figure without a face” ran across the road in
        front of them before it jumped over a 4 meter fence which stood across
        the road from them.
      </p>


      <img class="media" src="jack3-was-the-original-inspiration-for-batman-a-creepy-victorian-menace.jpeg" alt="A devilish comic book version of Jack is attacking citizens.">

      <p>
        Many still believe that Jack is a demon, or an alien, but the true source
        of his many appearances is not really out of this World. Sceptics have long
        pointed out that the sightings as are Jack’s, usually just stories which
        by ways of plagiarism or creation of mass hysteria become urban legends.
        That is how, according to this version of the story, although indirectly,
        Batman came to be.

      <h2 class="title">Bitcoin Legalized In Germany</h2>
      <p>
        Bitcoin was legalized in Germany for the purpose of paying taxes, which
        makes Germany the first country that uses this online currency as a regular
        one. Berlin recognized the virtual tender as a current currency and
        private money, according to the the german newspaper Die Welt.
      </p>
      <p>
        Classification actually means that some commercial profits which are
        connected with Bitcoin may be taxed, however, personal use of this online
        currency still remains freed from taxes, the paper reported.
      </p>
      <p>
        The recognition of Bitcoin was actually published by the Ministry of
        Finance, when Frank Schäffler, member of parliament of the financial
        committee wrote: “For the first time, the government recognizes and
        approves of Bitcoin as a personal currency.”
      </p>
      <p>
        In July, the first company for trading Bitcoins was established in Germany
        by direct cooperation with the banks that regulate the Authority for
        Financial Supervision. Bitcoin Deutschland GmbH agreed to make Bitcon
        transactions happen on its platform as an intermediary, through Germany’s
        Web 2.0 bank, Fidor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bitcoin was a very popular payment method since its emergence in 2009., as
        a product of people’s disappointment in the conventional payment system.
        In the meantime, the validity of Bitcoin as a currency was in question,
        because it lacked approval of the US Government and the Central Bank.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the beginning of august, the federal judge in Texas declared that
        Bitcoin is a legitimate currency. The decision was made after Trendon
        Shavers, a thirty-year old businessman, was charged for setting up ponzi
        schemes, where he stole 4.5 million dollars worth in crypto currency by
        conning his customers through online hedgefonds. He claimed that Bitcoin
        is not real money, and that it should therefore not to be regulated by the
        US Government. However, the court rejected his claim.
      </p>
      <p>
        This decision took Bitcoin one step closer to be recognized as a real
        currency. Still this same decision created a possibility that the virtual
        currency be regulated by the Government, which is in opposition with
        Bitcoin’s original concept of peer-to-peer, relatively anonymous payment.
      </p>
      <p>
        The people that support this virtual currency point out that the usage of
        it protects them from theft and credit card fraud. The critics, however,
        note that the absence
        of regular protection systems makes theft more likely, while the sceptics
        constantly ask questions about exchange rates, the risk of loss of profit
        and the rigidity of its acquiring.
      </p>
      <p>
        The group that supervised Bitcoin, asked that the total value of crypto
        currency be limited to $21 million. At this time, the value of a single
        bitcoin is estimated to be arour $110.

      <p>
        Do you know how the kid from your neighbourhood spent his free time on
        burning ants with a magnifying glass? This is the same thing - except
        that instead of using a magnifying glass, he is using a big ol’ Fresnel
        lens. Instead of frying insects, he is melting sand into glass objects!

      <p>
        Designed by the artist Markus Kayser, the SolarSinter concept is not that
        different from laser sintering printers used by corporations such as
        SpaceX to print objects from metals that would normally be impossible to
        do. Although a focused sun ray is far less precise than a finely tuned
        laser, in its essence, the concept is still the same.

      <h2 class="title">BMW Launches the i3 Electric Car</h2>
      <p>
        The German manufacturer of luxury vehicles, BMW, unveiled to the World its
        first electric vehicles, which will go through mass manufacturing this
        Monday.
      </p>
      <p>
        BMW i3 has a grill in the shape of the unique BMW logo, but what lays
        underneath the bonnet does not resemble his brethren at all. The i3 has
        an electric engine with 170hpw and a lithium-ion high voltage battery
        which can keep the car in motion anywhere between 120 and 160km under
        one charge. This four seat vehicle can be charged via a regular electrical
        socket, public charging stations or with a special BMW Wallbox charger.
      </p>
      <p>
        The i3 is also available with the optional distance extender - a two
        cylinder gas powered engine of 34hpw which is located next to the electric
        motor. Although it may seem somewhat contradictory to the green goals of
        this car, this engine extended the maximum travel distance of this vehicle
        to 300 kilometers. The car has a speed limit of up to 150 km/h due to
        safety reasons, according to BMW.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a weight of about 1195 kg, the hatchback styled car has an aluminium
        chassis and a carbon fibre cabin. The car is also paired with BMW’s
        iRemote application (which supports both iOS and Android phones), which
        contains data about the charge level of the car battery, her health,
        the location of the car, as well as service messages on your smartphone.
      </p>
      <p>
        The i3 will first be released for sale in Germany and other European
        markets in November. BMW said that the base price of the i3 in Germany
        will be 34950 euros. The electric car will be released for sale in the
        US, China and Japan in the first half of 2014. In the US, the car will
        start selling at the price of $41,350 or for $45,200 for the extended
        range model.
      </p>
      <p>
        This move of BMW could rush competitors such as Mercedes-Benz or Audi to
        bring their electric technologies to the market. The i3 makes room for
        itself in the growing electric vehicle market; it is not par with the
        expensive as Tesla, however it has a far more refined looked that other
        electric cars e.g. Nissan Leaf and Chevy Volt.
      </p>
      <p>
        As time moves on, there could be more electric cars from BMW as the German
        manufacturer has unveiled conceptual details about the i8 model, a hybrid
        electric sports car. In addition, Mini, which is under the ownership of
        BMW, is testing the electric version of its little car MINI E.
      </p>
      <p>
        What do you think about the new i3? Would you like to have one in your
        garage some day or would you prefer other electric vehicles?
      </p>

      <h2 class="title">Comic-Con: RoboCop Remake Shows Footage to Fans</h2>
      <p>
        At today's San Diego Comic-Con, Sony Pictures gave its first glimpse of
        the upcoming RoboCop remake. Stars Joel Kinnman, Abby Cornish, Samuel L.
        Jackson, Michael Keaton and director Jose Padilla were present and
        available during the projection of the title’s trailer, which is set to be
        released in 2014.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first scene to be shown is a TV news sequence which reports on
        OmniCorp’s commission of fighting droid and the ED 209 during the American
        occupation of Iran during Operation Freedom. The news reporter who is
        within the robotic army unit talks about their success in peacekeeping,
        however, we can see that they are actually terrorizing unarmed civilians,
        at which moment the ground started shaking and the OmniCorp droids
        turned lethal. This entire TV news sequence was lead by Pat Novak,
        a reporter on a TV station which resembles Fox News (Jackson described
        the character as Russ Sharpton, like a fusion of the famous duo of Russ
        Limbo and Al Sharpton).</p>
      <p>
        In this Robocop, police officer Alex Murphy(Kinnman) did not kill the
        cruel criminal with his mercenary crew, he wasn’t actually killed at all.
        He was badly wounded by a car bomb which left him with burns all over his
        body. To save him and give OmniCorp their desired cybor protector of
        justice, Omni scientist dr Norton (Gary Oldman), amputated Alex’s body
        from the neck down and reconstructed him into RoboCop (they keep Alex’s
        right arm as a human element when Robocop is shaking people’s hands).
      </p>
      <p>
        There were a couple of scenes with the director of OmniCorp, Raymond
        Sellars (Keaton), a man that believes in his products and in what they
        can do for the World, who makes his decisions not so that he could become
        the villain, but rather he decided that it was the best business decision
        for what he thinks that he can offer. Keaton described Sellars as more of
        an antagonist than a villain.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was no equivalent to the completely evil Clarence Boddicker villain
        in the clip that we saw, however we saw a lot of night vision footage,
        which look like first-person video games, from the perspective of
        different armed assaulters which were stupid enough to attack RoboCop.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another difference from the original movie is that Murphy’s wife, Clara,
        is still beside him, since he is not dead. Her efforts to recognise
        something human in what Alex has bercom and his inevitable tendency to do
        the same, is apparently what leads the story rather than some story about
        some great villains.
      </p>
      <p>
        Generally, RoboCop looked decent. Honestly, the footage was not enough to
        dismiss the concerns that can be had for this project. It could be
        surprisingly good like Judge Dredd 3D, or it could become stale and
        disappointing as the Total Recall remake. We shall see, although, if the
        intention bringing a new RoboCOp to Comic-Con was to show the fans how
        different the movie was from the original, and how the new approach to
        RoboCop can work, then they have succeeded in that (By the way, the new
        suit looks pretty good in motion, so stop worrying about the pictures
        from the set).

      <h2 class="title">The Age of Alien Laptop has Arrived!</h2>
      <p>
        This morning, the Alienware 13 laptop was announced, who will go down in
        history as the first laptop which will be completely involved in the
        gaming world. The laptop itself represents an upgraded version of the
        Alienware 14, except that that in itself is no big news, however, he has
        the ability to connect with a proprietary external device that you have
        dreamed about.
      </p>

      <p>
        With a simple name, the Alienware Graphics Amplifier is a proprietary
        device in which you can insert a PCI express graphics card. The price of
        the device itself, without the graphics card, is 300 euros. For now, the
        device can only be connected to the ALienware 13 laptop, while it was
        announced that it is going to be able to connect to the revised versions
        of bigger models such as the Alienware 14, 17, and 18, all of which will
        have the required port.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Alienware Graphics Amplifier comes with a 460W PSU, a PSIe x16 slot
        and can support graphics cards of up to 375W TDP. It has all the necessary
        6-pin and 8-pin power connectors, so it can support more powerful
        graphics cards, whose power consumption is quite substantial. The device
        is 18cm wide and 40 cm long. To connect the device, you need to have the
        proprietary cable, which represents a combination of USBa and PCI express.
      </p>

      <p>
        When starting up the Alienware Graphics Amplifier, the graphics card of
        the Alienware 13 laptop is completely ignored, and according to that,
        when the device is turned off, the graphics card of the laptop resumes
        with its normal functionality. For now, no magazine had the opportunity
        to test out this device, however we have official data about its
        performance from Alienware. Because Alienware is in good standing as a
        manufacturer of high-end machines, we can say with certainty that the data
        that we can see in the next picture are correct. With the exception of
        some rare games that are limited by the processor’s power. The Alienware
        Graphics Amplifier should be able to give you the same performance as
        desktop computers.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>The question is: will Alienware (Dell) want to share this patent with
          other laptop manufacturers?</b> The cable represents a combination of
        USBa and PCI express, which means that, if Dell will stand by the
        standards this way of connecting will be able to be implemented by the
        rest of the manufacturers. Just imagine that you have an Alienware
        Graphics Amplifier on your job, or at home, and that you can connect

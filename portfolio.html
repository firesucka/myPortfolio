    <h2 class="title">Was spring-heeled Jack Bataman's greatgrandfather?</h2>
    <p>
      <b>In the long past year of 1839, at the beginning of England’s Victorian
        Era, rumours started to circle of a mysterious figure that was wandering
        through the villages near London. Under the veil of darkness, it would
        attack women, tearing up
        their clothing with its claws…</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      This description would suit yet another masked figure - except that
      Batman would focus on criminals instead of young women.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rumours about him spread quickly, thanks to the fact that his first
      close encounter with an 80-year-old Jane Aslop was published, along with
      his description. She insisted that it was a monster: “it spat blue and
      white flames” and it “tore
      my neck with its claws”.
    </p>

    <img class="media" src="pictures\spring-heeled-jack\jack-2-was-the-original-inspiration-for-batman-a-creepy-victorian-menace.jpeg" alt="This is an image of Jack scaring young women.">
    <p>
      Many people of that time believed that Spring-heeled Jack - as they have
      called this creature - was in fact a monster capable of moving at an
      incomprehensible speed and that it sometimes leapt 6 meters into the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      The official response was that all of these sightings were linked to a
      letter which was sent to the lord mayor of London, published earlier in
      early 1838:
    </p>
    <p>
      “It seems like some individuals have made a bet about an ominous and
      inconsiderate friend (still of an unknown name), who does not dare to
      accept the blame on himself for visiting a lot of villages near London,
      being disguised as three figures - a ghost, a bear and a devil.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Many have suspected the aristocrat Henry Beresford, Marquess of Waterford,
      a man which was renowned in the city during that time - however, nothing
      has been proven.
    </p>

    <p>
      (Wait a second! A famous, powerful young man who was suspected to be the
      ominous figure and who was under the cover of darkness? Did Bruce Wayne
      have a Victorian great grandfather?)
    </p>

    <p>
      And so, the legend rose of the aristocrat that wandered the villages,
      terrorizing young women, in a similar fashion as had Jack the Ripper 50
      years later in London itself.
    </p>

    <img class="media" src="pictures\spring-heeled-jack\jack-4-was-the-original-inspiration-for-batman-a-creepy-victorian-menace.jpeg" alt="Jack is encountering some British Soldiers.">

    <p>
      In the coming decades, rumours about Jack and his foul deeds spread
      further - even though reports of him became rarer, people across England
      talked about mysterious attacks on post chariots, women being assaulted,
      and up until 1877, they even
      talked about groups of soldiers being attacked by the figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rumours about it being a demon which was summoned by occult devil
      worshipers have spread, it was even said that it was not of this world -
      it was seen in a similar fashion as Batman was by the criminals he was
      chasing at the beginning of his crime-fighting career.
    </p>


    <img class="media" src="pictures\spring-heeled-jack\jack5-was-the-original-inspiration-for-batman-a-creepy-victorian-menace.jpeg" alt="Jackm portrayed as the devil, attacks people attending the church.">

    <p>
      Things became even more strange… After 1870, rumours about Jack became
      rarer. Eventually, he started to emerge in works of fiction. His first
      appearance was as a melodramatic anti-hero, then, sometime later, he
      emerged as some kind of
      superhero.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thing is, Spring-heeled Jack was finished long before Batman’s
      creation.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the late 20th century, Jack began to reemerge - he even traversed
      the Atlantic ocean, having his first appearance in Northern Carolina in
      1973 - described as “a skinny, long-haired man with pointy ears and
      glowing red eyes, who leapt 50 to 65 feet into the air.”
    </p>


    <img class="media" src="pictures\spring-heeled-jack\jack6-was-the-original-inspiration-for-batman-a-creepy-victorian-menace.jpeg" alt="Jack on the rooftops portraying looking a lot like batman.">

    <p>
      Texas locals saw that “the creature was 6 feet tall, had pointy ears, and
      jumped across the football field in just a couple of leaps - like an
      astronaut on the Moon.” in 1979.
    </p>
    <p>Even to this day, Jack still appears.</p>

    <p>
      Allegedly, in 2012 it terrorized a family in England, which claimed that
      it saw as “the mysterious figure without a face” ran across the road in
      front of them before it jumped over a 4 meter fence which stood across
      the road from them.
    </p>


    <img class="media" src="pictures\spring-heeled-jack\jack3-was-the-original-inspiration-for-batman-a-creepy-victorian-menace.jpeg" alt="A devilish comic book version of Jack is attacking citizens.">

    <p>
      Many still believe that Jack is a demon, or an alien, but the true source
      of his many appearances is not really out of this World. Sceptics have long
      pointed out that the sightings as are Jack’s, usually just stories which
      by ways of plagiarism or creation of mass hysteria become urban legends.
      That is how, according to this version of the story, although indirectly,
      Batman came to be.

    <h2 class="title">Bitcoin Legalized In Germany</h2>
    <p>
      Bitcoin was legalized in Germany for the purpose of paying taxes, which
      makes Germany the first country that uses this online currency as a regular
      one. Berlin recognized the virtual tender as a current currency and
      private money, according to the the german newspaper Die Welt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Classification actually means that some commercial profits which are
      connected with Bitcoin may be taxed, however, personal use of this online
      currency still remains freed from taxes, the paper reported.
    </p>
    <p>
      The recognition of Bitcoin was actually published by the Ministry of
      Finance, when Frank Schäffler, member of parliament of the financial
      committee wrote: “For the first time, the government recognizes and
      approves of Bitcoin as a personal currency.”
    </p>
    <p>
      In July, the first company for trading Bitcoins was established in Germany
      by direct cooperation with the banks that regulate the Authority for
      Financial Supervision. Bitcoin Deutschland GmbH agreed to make Bitcon
      transactions happen on its platform as an intermediary, through Germany’s
      Web 2.0 bank, Fidor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bitcoin was a very popular payment method since its emergence in 2009., as
      a product of people’s disappointment in the conventional payment system.
      In the meantime, the validity of Bitcoin as a currency was in question,
      because it lacked approval of the US Government and the Central Bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the beginning of august, the federal judge in Texas declared that
      Bitcoin is a legitimate currency. The decision was made after Trendon
      Shavers, a thirty-year old businessman, was charged for setting up ponzi
      schemes, where he stole 4.5 million dollars worth in crypto currency by
      conning his customers through online hedgefonds. He claimed that Bitcoin
      is not real money, and that it should therefore not to be regulated by the
      US Government. However, the court rejected his claim.
    </p>
    <p>
      This decision took Bitcoin one step closer to be recognized as a real
      currency. Still this same decision created a possibility that the virtual
      currency be regulated by the Government, which is in opposition with
      Bitcoin’s original concept of peer-to-peer, relatively anonymous payment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The people that support this virtual currency point out that the usage of
      it protects them from theft and credit card fraud. The critics, however,
      note that the absence
      of regular protection systems makes theft more likely, while the sceptics
      constantly ask questions about exchange rates, the risk of loss of profit
      and the rigidity of its acquiring.
    </p>
    <p>
      The group that supervised Bitcoin, asked that the total value of crypto
      currency be limited to $21 million. At this time, the value of a single
      bitcoin is estimated to be arour $110.

    <h2 class="title">3D Printing With Sand with The Aid of the Sun</h2>
    <p>
      Do you know how the kid from your neighbourhood spent his free time on
      burning ants with a magnifying glass? This is the same thing - except
      that instead of using a magnifying glass, he is using a big ol’ Fresnel
      lens. Instead of frying insects, he is melting sand into glass objects!

    <p>
      Designed by the artist Markus Kayser, the SolarSinter concept is not that
      different from laser sintering printers used by corporations such as
      SpaceX to print objects from metals that would normally be impossible to
      do. Although a focused sun ray is far less precise than a finely tuned
      laser, in its essence, the concept is still the same.

    <h2 class="title">BMW Launches the i3 Electric Car</h2>
    <p>
      The German manufacturer of luxury vehicles, BMW, unveiled to the World its
      first electric vehicles, which will go through mass manufacturing this
      Monday.
    </p>
    <p>
      BMW i3 has a grill in the shape of the unique BMW logo, but what lays
      underneath the bonnet does not resemble his brethren at all. The i3 has
      an electric engine with 170hpw and a lithium-ion high voltage battery
      which can keep the car in motion anywhere between 120 and 160 km under
      one charge. This four seat vehicle can be charged via a regular electrical
      socket, public charging stations or with a special BMW Wallbox charger.
    </p>
    <p>
      The i3 is also available with the optional distance extender - a two
      cylinder gas powered engine of 34hpw which is located next to the electric
      motor. Although it may seem somewhat contradictory to the green goals of
      this car, this engine extended the maximum travel distance of this vehicle
      to 300 kilometers. The car has a speed limit of up to 150 km/h due to
      safety reasons, according to BMW.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a weight of about 1195 kg, the hatchback styled car has an aluminium
      chassis and a carbon fibre cabin. The car is also paired with BMW’s
      iRemote application (which supports both iOS and Android phones), which
      contains data about the charge level of the car battery, her health,
      the location of the car, as well as service messages on your smartphone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The i3 will first be released for sale in Germany and other European
      markets in November. BMW said that the base price of the i3 in Germany
      will be 34950 euros. The electric car will be released for sale in the
      US, China and Japan in the first half of 2014. In the US, the car will
      start selling at the price of $41,350 or for $45,200 for the extended
      range model.
    </p>
    <p>
      This move of BMW could rush competitors such as Mercedes-Benz or Audi to
      bring their electric technologies to the market. The i3 makes room for
      itself in the growing electric vehicle market; it is not par with the
      expensive as Tesla, however it has a far more refined looked that other
      electric cars e.g. Nissan Leaf and Chevy Volt.
    </p>
    <p>
      As time moves on, there could be more electric cars from BMW as the German
      manufacturer has unveiled conceptual details about the i8 model, a hybrid
      electric sports car. In addition, Mini, which is under the ownership of
      BMW, is testing the electric version of its little car MINI E.
    </p>
    <p>
      What do you think about the new i3? Would you like to have one in your
      garage some day or would you prefer other electric vehicles?

    <h2 class="title">Comic-Con: RoboCop Remake Shows Footage to Fans</h2>
    <p>
      At today's San Diego Comic-Con, Sony Pictures gave its first glimpse of
      the upcoming RoboCop remake. Stars Joel Kinnman, Abby Cornish, Samuel L.
      Jackson, Michael Keaton and director Jose Padilla were present and
      available during the projection of the title’s trailer, which is set to be
      released in 2014.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first scene to be shown is a TV news sequence which reports on
      OmniCorp’s commission of fighting droid and the ED 209 during the American
      occupation of Iran during Operation Freedom. The news reporter who is
      within the robotic army unit talks about their success in peacekeeping,
      however, we can see that they are actually terrorizing unarmed civilians,
      at which moment the ground started shaking and the OmniCorp droids
      turned lethal. This entire TV news sequence was lead by Pat Novak,
      a reporter on a TV station which resembles Fox News (Jackson described
      the character as Russ Sharpton, like a fusion of the famous duo of Russ
      Limbo and Al Sharpton).</p>
    <p>
      In this Robocop, police officer Alex Murphy(Kinnman) did not kill the
      cruel criminal with his mercenary crew, he wasn’t actually killed at all.
      He was badly wounded by a car bomb which left him with burns all over his
      body. To save him and give OmniCorp their desired cybor protector of
      justice, Omni scientist dr Norton (Gary Oldman), amputated Alex’s body
      from the neck down and reconstructed him into RoboCop (they keep Alex’s
      right arm as a human element when Robocop is shaking people’s hands).
    </p>
    <p>
      There were a couple of scenes with the director of OmniCorp, Raymond
      Sellars (Keaton), a man that believes in his products and in what they
      can do for the World, who makes his decisions not so that he could become
      the villain, but rather he decided that it was the best business decision
      for what he thinks that he can offer. Keaton described Sellars as more of
      an antagonist than a villain.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no equivalent to the completely evil Clarence Boddicker villain
      in the clip that we saw, however we saw a lot of night vision footage,
      which look like first-person video games, from the perspective of
      different armed assaulters which were stupid enough to attack RoboCop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another difference from the original movie is that Murphy’s wife, Clara,
      is still beside him, since he is not dead. Her efforts to recognise
      something human in what Alex has bercom and his inevitable tendency to do
      the same, is apparently what leads the story rather than some story about
      some great villains.
    </p>

      Generally, RoboCop looked decent. Honestly, the footage was not enough to
      dismiss the concerns that can be had for this project. It could be
      surprisingly good like Judge Dredd 3D, or it could become stale and
      disappointing as the Total Recall remake. We shall see, although, if the
      intention bringing a new RoboCOp to Comic-Con was to show the fans how
      different the movie was from the original, and how the new approach to
      RoboCop can work, then they have succeeded in that (By the way, the new
      suit looks pretty good in motion, so stop worrying about the pictures
      from the set).

    <h2 class="title">The Age of Alien Laptop has Arrived!</h2>
    <p>
      This morning, the Alienware 13 laptop was announced, who will go down in
      history as the first laptop which will be completely involved in the
      gaming world. The laptop itself represents an upgraded version of the
      Alienware 14, except that that in itself is no big news, however, he has
      the ability to connect with a proprietary external device that you have
      dreamed about.
    </p>

    <p>
      With a simple name, the Alienware Graphics Amplifier is a proprietary
      device in which you can insert a PCI express graphics card. The price of
      the device itself, without the graphics card, is 300 euros. For now, the
      device can only be connected to the ALienware 13 laptop, while it was
      announced that it is going to be able to connect to the revised versions
      of bigger models such as the Alienware 14, 17, and 18, all of which will
      have the required port.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Alienware Graphics Amplifier comes with a 460W PSU, a PSIe x16 slot
      and can support graphics cards of up to 375W TDP. It has all the necessary
      6-pin and 8-pin power connectors, so it can support more powerful
      graphics cards, whose power consumption is quite substantial. The device
      is 18cm wide and 40 cm long. To connect the device, you need to have the
      proprietary cable, which represents a combination of USBa and PCI express.
    </p>

    <p>
      When starting up the Alienware Graphics Amplifier, the graphics card of
      the Alienware 13 laptop is completely ignored, and according to that,
      when the device is turned off, the graphics card of the laptop resumes
      with its normal functionality. For now, no magazine had the opportunity
      to test out this device, however we have official data about its
      performance from Alienware. Because Alienware is in good standing as a
      manufacturer of high-end machines, we can say with certainty that the data
      that we can see in the next picture are correct. With the exception of
      some rare games that are limited by the processor’s power. The Alienware
      Graphics Amplifier should be able to give you the same performance as
      desktop computers.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>The question is: will Alienware (Dell) want to share this patent with
        other laptop manufacturers?</b> The cable represents a combination of
      USBa and PCI express, which means that, if Dell will stand by the
      standards this way of connecting will be able to be implemented by the
      rest of the manufacturers. Just imagine that you have an Alienware
      Graphics Amplifier on your job, or at home, and that you can connect
      it with any available laptop. Wouldn’t that be great? Please take a
      look at the following clip to see what’s it all about.

    <h2 class="title">Is Google Making A Robot Army In Secrecy?</h2>
    <p>
      Just imagine a future in which the word Google and the internet giants motto “Don’t be evil” printed on the factory workers, on the delivery people, soldiers, caretakers and housekeepers. Except that they are working for the most powerful
      internet company in the world, all of these workers would have something else in common - all of them would be robots.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ther online search giant already dominates our lives in such a way that it has become uncomfortable, with its intrusive global mapping, shameless gathering of our private data and Google Glass, the spectacles-styled computer, which will
      transmit everything that the user will be seeing to the company as client information for potential ad targeting. It is even patenting an electronic throat tattoo which could enable its owners to give their smart devices voice commands.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many of us do not need any assurance to think that this multinational company set in California, is very creepy. Still the news that it has begun buying all of the leading manufacturers of robots and robotic parts around the world surprised
      many in the tech world. When it came up that Google even bought the military robot pioneer, Boston Dynamics, curiosity turned into alarm. There was a talk about an android apocalypse and a comparison to Skynet - the evil artificial intelligence
      system in the sci-fi Terminator movies, that is trying to wipe out humanity with its lethal robots.
    </p>

    <p>
      Boston Dynamics is certainly making some creepy stuff: animal-like robots and human-like machines with eerily realistic capabilities of running, lifting and jumping, which could transform the future of warfare.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of their creations, Big Dog, whose 2 pairs of human-like legs are so agile that they can trip and regain their balance, or even recover from a fall, even on ice when they are forcefully kicked by a man. When you attach an arm to it, Big Dog
      can throw huge concrete blocks up with a range of up to 6meters.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is also Cheetah, which can run at the speed of 45 km/h, which is faster than Usain Bolt!
      <br>
      Atlas, the bipedal robot which is 187 cm tall, looks disturbingly similar to the terrifying cyborg terminator from the movie. <b>It can drive a car, walk on bad terrain and is virtually indestructible - it can still balance on one foot even
        though it has been hit by a wrecking ball!</b>
    </p>

    <p>
      When it comes to the humanoid Petman (whose original purpose was to be used for testing chemical protection clothing), it can run up the stairs and do push ups.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wildcat gallops like a headless metal horse, carries weight and listens to voice commands.
      <br>
      The little Sand Flea moves thanks to its two pairs of wheels, it weighs only 5kg, however, it can jump up to 9 meters into the air - tall enough to jump onto a house roof!
    </p>

    <p>
      The best customer of Boston Dynamics is the secretive Pentagon’s extension for technological investigation, DARPA. The pentagon says that the robots would play an important role in regions that have been through a toxic catastrophe where people
      may not be able to go. What he doesn’t mention is that it would be quite convenient for killing people.
    </p>

    <p>
      You could only hope but wonder, what could an internet company do with such nightmarish machinery? The sceptics have long talked about Google as some kind of a dangerous corporate villain, in the style of those from James Bond movies, working
      in secrecy towards world domination. Are perhaps conspiracy theorists right?
    </p>

    <p>
      Larry Page, Google’s co-founder, has long talked about how the aim of technology is to liberate man from strenuous and repetitive work. Andy Rubin, Google’s chief of robotics and tech wizard who developed the Android OS for phones, said that
      within a decade, robots will replace Google’s factory workers and their delivery personnel.

    <h2 class="title">Hugh Jackman Is (Not) Sure That Wolverine 3 Will Be The Last Time That He Portrays Logan</h2>
    <p>
      Hugh Jackman has been in the role of the Wolverine six time till now, including the upcoming movie X-Men: Days of Future Past, however many are wondering, just like Hugh himself, how long will he still be wearing the Logan costume. We have
      recently found out that there are plans for a third Wolverine movie for 2017, however, as the actor himself says, he is not so sure that he will repeat his role: “I still don’t know. We are talking about it. I am still interested for the role,
      and I feel that we have corrected the course with the last movie. However, I think that we can move forward in a way. If I do another movie, I am 99,9% sure that that will be the last one” - said Jackman.
    </p>

    <p>
      Certainly this can be just a tactic to get “better” pay from FOX. It was not the first or the last time that an actor created some noise in the media in order to get greater pay. I can certainly not imagine anyone else in the role of Logan
      except him. Also, I have to mention that another movie is coming out in 2016 - X-Men Apocalypse.
    </p>

    <p>
      According to FOX, Apocalypse is coming out in may 2016, and Wolverine 3 is scheduled for March 2017, which means that Hugh Jackman might have time for the shooting of both movies. I also have to mention that the story from these two movies are
      not set in the same time period. Apocalypse is set in the 80’s, just as X-Men: First Class, so there is a possibility that Wolverine 3 could be set in the future!
    </p>

    <p>
      So, what story can we expect for the future Wolverine?! According to everything, that will be the adaptation of the famous Mark Millar comic book Old Man Logan.
    </p>

    <p>
      This movie should finally connect Wolverine with some other heroes from Marvel’s library, such as Hulk and Hawkeye. However, that is yet to be seen, as Fox has the rights to X-Men, Spider-Man and the Fantastic Four characters, while Marvel
      Studios has the rights to all the others from their Universe. Will there be some cooperation between these two studios or will they change the plot of the movie in its entirety?! What do you think about that?

    <h2 class="title">Jetpack Flight Becomes A Reality</h2>
    <p>
      The jetpack is the essence of futuristic travel and if everything goes well for the New Zealand company Martin Aircraft, you will soon have the opportunity to get your hands on one. Looking like a Wile E. Coyote invention, or something from a
      James Bond movie, the Martin jetpack is designed for travel of up to 100 km/h and it can go up to a height of 2,5km. This week Martin Aircraft performed a series of test flights with a pilot, and if everything goes well, they plan to sell their
      prosthetic versions in the year 2015.
    </p>

    <p>
      The jetpack runs on a petrol engine with two centrifugal propellers. The lift off from the ground is achieved at a speed of 4m/s at a height of a whopping 2,5km. Even though all of the test flights are planned for a height of 6m, the jetpack
      can move for 30 minutes at a top speed of around 100 km/h, and it is controlled via a joystick. The pilot is protected with a ballistic parachute and landing gear and will be able to lift off from small places. It is expected that it can take
      off on reasonable weather conditions.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first functional prototype was revealed in 2008, and after getting permission for experimental flights from the New Zealand Aviation Authority, the company must make sure that this jetpack works properly before it is released for sale.

    <h2 class="title">The Chinese Are Making Their Own Version Of Google Glass</h2>
    <img class="media" src="pictures\baidu-eye\BaiduEye.jpg" alt="The Baidu Eye">
    <p>
      China’s internet giant Baidu, has unveiled its version of Google Glass for the first time, this Wednesday
    </p>

    <p>
      A functional prototype of the wearable tech gadget called “Baidu Eye”, was displayed on Baidu’s World conference in Beijing in April 2013, and it was firstly compared with Google Glass.
    </p>


    <p>
      In contrast to Glass, Baidu Eye does not have any screen or optical display. Instead of that, the device looks like a wraparound headset that is worn on the wearers ears. According to the specifications of the company, the left stick has a
      microphone, while the right one has a camera that captures photos, recognizes objects and analyses information from its environment.
    </p>


    <p>
      Baidu Eye sends information to its users phone or table through an application. Attempting to make a strike at Google, the company said that “this method makes searching easier than it would be with an attached screen”, and that it aims to
      ”make the device consume less energy, making the battery last longer”.
    </p>
    <img class="media" src="pictures\baidu-eye\baidu-eye-on-manequin.jpg" alt="Bidu Eye on a head manequin">
    <p>
      The Baidu Eye can synchronize both visual (through the smartphone - a bigger screen reduces eye strain in comparison to the visual display of the Google Glass) and auditory information giving “the same functionality” as Glass.
    </p>


    <p>
      The device also has the function of voice and gesture commands, including “pinch to zoom” and “circling of objects with your finger”.
    </p>


    <p>
      It can also find products, such as bags and clothing, on e-commerce stores.
    </p>

    <img class="media" src="pictures\baidu-eye\baidu-eye-2.jpg" alt="A young woman with a colorful purse wears the Baidu Eye">
    <p>
      When Baidu confirmed the existence of this device last April, it seemed to have a screen. Then the director of the company for international communication Kaiser Kuo, said that Baidu Eye has the function of voice recognition for Mandarin, as
      well as the ability to perform an image search. Here’s a picture of what it looked like then.
    </p>

    <img class="media" src="pictures\baidu-eye\baidu-eye-prototype.jpg" alt="A man wears the Baidu Eye Prototype">

    <p>
      In April 2013, Kuo said that Baidu is performing internal testing and evaluation of the device in order to determine if the product has marketing potential. And it seemed like it had.
    </p>

    <p>
      Baidu Eye is still in the prototype stadium; the company currently has no information about the price and availability.

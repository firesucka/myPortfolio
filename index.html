    <p>
      My name is Ivan Pomorisac, and I am an aspiring freelance content/article writer.
      On this page you will be able to see all of my work, which currently consists of 32 articles,
      that were originally written in Serbian, which I have taken the time to translate into English,
      so that you may be able to see my work in the apropriate way. If you do like what you see,
      and my type of writing suits you well, please do not hesitate to contact me at <a href="pomorisacivan@gmail.com">pomorisacivan@gmail.com</a>,
      or at my Upwork profile <a href="https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01491a1611cf4d8d3a">https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01491a1611cf4d8d3a</a>.
